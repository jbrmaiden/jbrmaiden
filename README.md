## Hi there 👋 

Hi! I’m Jordan — a product-minded full-stack engineer who loves building clean, scalable systems and collaborating across functions to ship outcomes, not just features. I’ve led initiatives that connect big-data insights to seller value, automated notifications across external platforms, and streamlined analytics/presentation workflows.
